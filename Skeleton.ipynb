    "K-means 聚类， 使用sklearn。 对于一个数据集，模型是确定的：即利用数值变量（numerical variable)来建模。\n",
    "变动的是：subgroups。\n",

    "Assume that we have numerical variables $X_1, X_2, ..., X_n$, we fit a k means model on the $n$ numerical variables and there are $K$ clusters.\n",

    "**Subgroup的严密定义**：\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose now we have categorical variables as $F_1, F_2, ..., F_m$. For each variable $F_i$, it takes $k_i$ different values: {$l_{i, 1}, l_{i, 2}, ..., l_{i, k_i}$}\n",

    "A subgroup $G$ is defined as below\n",
    "\n",
    "$G := \\wedge_j \\{F_j = v_j\\}$, where $v_j$ takes value from {$l_{j, 1}, l_{j, 2}, ..., l_{j, k_j}$}\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that, for a subgroup, not all the categorical variables would be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say, in the car dataset, we have categorical variables *engineType, doorNum, powerType, fuelType, etc*. When defining a subgroup, we may only consider *engineType* and *fuelType* (Just an example, we do not have any assumption). This would be important for the following process.\n",

    "**Subgroup Similarity / 组间相似性**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a subgroup $G$, suppose it involves the following categorical variables $F_{g1}, F_{g2}, ... F_{gk}$. Then, to find its most similar and distinct subgroups, we consider all other subgroups defined on these categorical variables $G_1, G_2, ..., G_{n_G}$. In previous part, we have $K$ clusters obtained from the k-means model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the given subgroup $G$, there are samples with different numerical variable values. We compute the proportions of samples that are classified into each cluster. For instance, 25% of the samples in $G$ would be in the first cluster, 15% of the samples in $G$ would be in the second cluster, etc. We define a corresponding feature vector $h_G$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$h_G = (p_1^{(G)}, p_2^{(G)}, ..., p_K^{(G)})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p_i^{(G)}$ stands for the proportion of samples in $G$ that are classified into the $i^{th}$ cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we compute the feature vector for all other subgroups and obtain $H_G = \\{ h_{G_1}, h_{G_2}..., h_{G_{n_G}}\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "At last, we compute the inner products between $h_G$ and all the elements in $H_G$. We choose the ones that have the smallest and largerst inner product values as the most similar and different subgroups.\n",
